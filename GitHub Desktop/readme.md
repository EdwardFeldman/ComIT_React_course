# GitHub Desktop

## Steps to commit your changes

### - Not in GitHub Desktop

1. Go to your repository in your computer
    1. This refers to the folder with the name of your repository. The name I suggested was ``react-comm-it``
2. Add the files to the proper folder
    1. Create a folder for each week
    2. Inside the week folder, create a folder for exercises named "Exercises", and create another folder named "
       Assignment" for assignments
    3. For each file, add it to the proper folder. If the file contains an exercise, then add it to the "Exercises"
       folder. If it's an
       assignment, then add it to the "Assignments" folder

### - In GitHub Desktop

1. Make sure you have added all the files to the correct folders. The files should show up on the left side of the
   GitHub Desktop windows
2. Below the section that displays the changes, there should be a field where you can add a description to your commit.
   Add a message saying what you are committing, for example:
    1. ``Add exercises and assignments for Week X``, where ``X`` refers to the number of the week
3. After adding a message for your commit, the button with the text "Commit to main" should now be enabled
4. Click the commit button
5. On the top area of GitHub desktop, there should be 3 buttons. The 3rd button from left to right should now say "Push
   Origin"
6. Click the button that says "Push Origin"

Your changes should be visible in your GitHub repository on the website.
